# Code of Conduct
## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, national origin, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
## Our Standards
1. Respectful Communication: Use welcoming and inclusive language. Show respect for the views and ideas of other members, even if you disagree.

2. Constructive Criticism: When giving or receiving feedback, remember the main goal is to contribute to project improvement. Provide clear, valuable and respectful feedback.

3. Focus on What is Best for The Community: Ensure that your contributions are made in the interest of the project and community, not personal benefits.
## Unacceptable Behavior:
1. The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

2. Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

3. Public or private harassment.

4. Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
## Responsibilities
Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.
## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project owner. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.
## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted in part from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4.
Let's join hands to make this community a welcoming and friendly place for all.
